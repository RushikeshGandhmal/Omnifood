## 📌 My process

- I started Udemy Course "Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS" by Jonas Schmedtmann.<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/" target="_blank"> **Check🚀 (Not Sponsered)**</a>
- I feel confident while writing CSS 👊.
- This project has given me the confidence to build any complex layouts 👊.
- Still, we all know that learning CSS is a never-ending process 🚫.

## 📌 What I Learn

👉 Web design principles.  
👉 How to optimize the website for production.  
👉 How to design a website from scratch.  
👉 Responsive Design (still Kevin Powell's Responsive Web Design course is the best)
